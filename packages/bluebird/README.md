Migrating from [FlutterBluePlus](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_blue_plus)? Check out the [migration guide](./MIGRATION.md).

## Quick Start

### Turn on
```dart
// On iOS this is controlled by the user
if (Platform.isAndroid) await Bluebird.turnOn();

// Wait for the adapter to become available
await Bluebird.adapterState.where((state) => state == BluetoothAdapterState.on).first;
```

### Scan for devices

```dart
await for (final ScanResult r in Bluebird.scan(withServices: [Uuid("180D")], withNames: ["Bluno"])) {
  print('${r.device.remoteId}: "${r.advertisementData.advName}"');
}
```

> [!TIP]
> No need to explicitly `startScan`/`stopScan` - once you break from the loop (or cancel the underlying subscription) the scan is automatically stopped!

### Connect to a device

```dart
// Obtain a device from a ScanResult
final BluetoothDevice device = scanResult.device;
//      Or from raw address: = BluetoothDevice.fromId("77:c6:24:e3:bb:ec");
await device.connect();

// Disconnect when you're done.
await device.disconnect();
```

### Discover services, characteristics & descriptors

```dart
await device.discoverServices();

final service = device.services.firstWhere((s) => s.uuid == Uuids.service.deviceInformation);
final characteristic = service.characteristics.firstWhere((c) => c.uuid == Uuids.characteristic.manufacturerName);
final descriptor = characteristic.descriptors.firstWhere((c) => c.uuid == Uuids.descriptors.characteristicUserDescription);
```

> [!WARNING]
> Calling `discoverServices` invalidates any previously discovered attributes as the underlying 
> Bluetooth handles may have changed. Always re-fetch from `device.services` if performing re-discovery.

### Subscribe to characteristic notifications

```dart
// Enables notifications (or indications) on the peripheral (check c.canNotify if unsure)
final subscription = characteristic.notifications.listen(
    (value) {
        // Called for each notification/indication
    },
    // The stream *errors* if the peripheral fails to enable notifications
    onError: (e) => print("failed to enable notify: $e"),
);

// Disables notifications on the peripheral
await subscription.cancel();
```

> [!TIP]
> No need to explicitly manage the underlying subscription state. If there are any active Flutter
> subscriptions the platform enables CCCD, and once all subscriptions are cancelled it disables CCCD.


### Read & write characteristics

```dart
// Read (check c.canRead if unsure)
List<int> value = await c.read();

// Write (check c.canWrite if unsure)
await c.write([0x12, 0x34]);
```

### Read & write descriptors

```dart
// Read
List<int> value = await d.read();

// Write
await d.write([0x12, 0x34])
```

## Example

Bluebird ships with an example app that is useful for debugging issues.

```
cd ./example
flutter run
```

## Project Setup

### Android

#### `minSdkVersion`

In `android/app/build.gradle`:

```gradle
android {
  defaultConfig {
     minSdkVersion: 24 // or higher
```

#### Permissions (without fine location)

In `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<!-- Tell Google Play Store that your app uses Bluetooth LE
     Set android:required="true" if bluetooth is necessary -->
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.bluetooth_le" android:required="false" />

<!-- New Bluetooth permissions in Android 12
https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/features/bluetooth-permissions -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN" android:usesPermissionFlags="neverForLocation" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT" />

<!-- legacy for Android 11 or lower -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" android:maxSdkVersion="30" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" android:maxSdkVersion="30" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" android:maxSdkVersion="30"/>

<!-- legacy for Android 9 or lower -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" android:maxSdkVersion="28" />
```

#### Permissions (with fine location)

If you want to use Bluetooth to determine location, or support iBeacons.

In `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<!-- Tell Google Play Store that your app uses Bluetooth LE
     Set android:required="true" if bluetooth is necessary -->
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.bluetooth_le" android:required="false" />

<!-- New Bluetooth permissions in Android 12
https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/features/bluetooth-permissions -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />

<!-- legacy for Android 11 or lower -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" android:maxSdkVersion="30" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" android:maxSdkVersion="30" />

<!-- legacy for Android 9 or lower -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" android:maxSdkVersion="28" />
```

And set **androidUsesFineLocation** when scanning:
```dart
// Start scanning
Bluebird.scan(androidUsesFineLocation: true).listen((r) { /* ... */ });
```

#### Proguard

In `project/android/app/proguard-rules.pro`:

```
-keep class com.lib.bluebird.* { *; }
```

To avoid seeing the following errors in your `release` builds:

```
PlatformException(startScan, Field androidScanMode_ for m0.e0 not found. Known fields are
 [private int m0.e0.q, private b3.b0$i m0.e0.r, private boolean m0.e0.s, private static final m0.e0 m0.e0.t,
 private static volatile b3.a1 m0.e0.u], java.lang.RuntimeException: Field androidScanMode_ for m0.e0 not found
```

### iOS

#### Permissions

In **ios/Runner/Info.plist**:

```dart
<dict>
    <key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
    <string>This app needs Bluetooth to function</string>
```

For location permissions on iOS see more at: [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/requesting_authorization_for_location_services](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/requesting_authorization_for_location_services)

### macOS

Make sure you have granted access to the Bluetooth hardware:

`Xcode -> Runners -> Targets -> Runner-> Signing & Capabilities -> App Sandbox -> Hardware -> Enable Bluetooth`


## Advanced Usage

### Error Handling

Every error returned by the native platform is checked and thrown as an exception where appropriate. See [Reference](#reference) for a list of throwable functions.

**Streams:** Most state streams returned by Bluebird (e.g. `adapterState`, `device.connectionState`, `device.mtu`) never emit errors and never close, so there's no need to handle `onError` or `onDone`. The exceptions are the *operation* streams that can fail: `Bluebird.scan()` (errors if a scan cannot start) and `characteristic.notifications` / `characteristic.values` (error if enabling notify fails) — handle `onError` on those.

### Set Log Level

```dart
// if your terminal doesn't support color you'll see annoying logs like `\x1B[1;35m`
Bluebird.setLogLevel(LogLevel.verbose, color:false)
```

Setting `LogLevel.verbose` shows *all* data in and out (⚫ = function name, 🟣 = args to platform, 🟡 = data from platform).

### Large characteristic writes

**allowLongWrite**: To write large characteristics (up to 512 bytes) regardless of mtu, use `allowLongWrite`:

```dart
/// allowLongWrite should be used with caution.
///   1. it can only be used *with* response to avoid data loss
///   2. the peripheral device must support the 'long write' ble protocol.
///   3. Interrupted transfers can leave the characteristic in a partially written state
///   4. If the mtu is small, it is very very slow.
await c.write(data, allowLongWrite: true);
```

**splitWrite**: To write lots of data (unlimited), you can define the `splitWrite` function.

```dart
import 'dart:math';
// split write should be used with caution.
//    1. due to splitting, `characteristic.read()` will return partial data.
//    2. it can only be used *with* response to avoid data loss
//    3. The characteristic must be designed to support split data
extension splitWrite on BluetoothCharacteristic {
  Future<void> splitWrite(List<int> value, {Duration timeout = const Duration(seconds: 15)}) async {
    int chunk = device.maxAttrLen.value; // mtu - 3 bytes BLE overhead, capped at 512
    for (int i = 0; i < value.length; i += chunk) {
      List<int> subvalue = value.sublist(i, min(i + chunk, value.length));
      await write(subvalue, withoutResponse:false, timeout: timeout);
    }
  }
}
```

### Values (including reads)

`characteristic.values` is like `notifications` but **also includes the result of
every `read()`**. It is convenient for characteristics that support both READ and
NOTIFY — e.g. a "light switch toggle". Like `notifications`, listening enables
notify; `valuesPassive` is the non-subscribing variant.

```dart
final subscription = characteristic.values.listen((value) {
    // emitted anytime read() is called *or* a notification arrives
});

await characteristic.read(); // also flows through `values`
await subscription.cancel();
```

### Keeping notify enabled independently

If you want to keep notify enabled regardless of who is listening — or share it
between several consumers — hold a `CharacteristicSubscription` from `subscribe()`
and observe the *passive* streams (which do **not** toggle notify themselves):

```dart
// enable notify and keep it on until you unsubscribe
final handle = await characteristic.subscribe();

// observe values without affecting the notify state
final sub = characteristic.notificationsPassive.listen((value) { /* ... */ });

// later — release your handle (disables notify once nothing else holds it)
await sub.cancel();
await handle.unsubscribe();
```

### Save Device

To save a device between app restarts, just store the `remoteId` to `SharedPreferences` or a file.

Now you can connect without needing to scan again, like so:

```dart
final String remoteId = await File('/remoteId.txt').readAsString();
var device = BluetoothDevice.fromId(remoteId);
await device.connect();
```

### MTU

On Android, we request an MTU of 517 by default during connection (see: `connect` function arguments).

On iOS & macOS, the MTU is negotiated automatically, typically 135 to 255.

```dart
final subscription = device.mtu.listen((int mtu) {
    // iOS: initial value is always 23, but iOS will quickly negotiate a higher value
    print("mtu $mtu");
});

// Cleanup: cancel subscription when disconnected
device.cancelWhenDisconnected(subscription);

// You can also manually change the mtu yourself.
if (Platform.isAndroid) await device.requestMtu(517);
```

### Services Changed Characteristic

Bluebird automatically listens to the Services Changed Characteristic (0x2A05)

In Bluebird, we call it `onServicesReset` because you must re-discover services.

```dart
// - uses the GAP Services Changed characteristic (0x2A05)
// - you must call discoverServices() again
device.onServicesReset.listen(() async {
    print("Services Reset");
    // a reset invalidates every previously discovered attribute; re-discover and
    // re-fetch anything you use, don't reuse old references.
    await device.discoverServices();
});
```

### Get Connected Devices

Get devices currently connected to your app.

```dart
for (BluetoothDevice d in Bluebird.connectedDevices) {
    print(d);
}
```

### Get System Devices

Get devices connected to the system by *any* app.

**Note:** before you can communicate, you must connect *your app* to these devices

```dart
// `withServices` required on iOS, ignored on android
List<Uuid> withServices = [Uuid("180F")];
List<BluetoothDevice> devs = await Bluebird.systemDevices(withServices);
for (final d in devs) {
    await d.connect(); // Must connect *our* app to the device
    await d.discoverServices();
}
```

### Create Bond (Android Only)

**Note:** calling this is usually not necessary!! The platform will do it automatically.

However, you can force the popup to show sooner.

```dart
final bsSubscription = device.bondState.listen((value) {
    print("$value prev:{$device.prevBondState}");
});

// cleanup: cancel subscription when disconnected
device.cancelWhenDisconnected(bsSubscription);

// Force the bonding popup to show now (Android Only)
await device.createBond();

// remove bond
await device.removeBond();
```

### Events API

`Bluebird.events` is a single broadcast stream of every event, from every device.
Each event is a subtype of the sealed `BluebirdEvent` class, so you can filter it
by type. Event types include:

* `OnConnectionStateChangedEvent`
* `OnMtuChangedEvent`
* `OnServicesResetEvent`
* `OnCharacteristicNotifiedEvent` / `OnCharacteristicReadEvent`
* `OnAdapterStateChangedEvent`
* `OnScanAdvertisementEvent` / `OnScanFailedEvent`
* `OnNameChangedEvent` (iOS only)
* `OnBondStateChangedEvent` (Android only)

```dart
// listen to *any device* connection state changes
Bluebird.events
    .where((e) => e is OnConnectionStateChangedEvent)
    .cast<OnConnectionStateChangedEvent>()
    .listen((event) {
  print('${event.device} ${event.connectionState}');
});

// or use the typed helper, which filters and casts for you
Bluebird.extractEventStream<OnConnectionStateChangedEvent>().listen((event) {
  print('${event.device} ${event.connectionState}');
});
```

Because every event is sealed, a `switch` over `Bluebird.events` is checked for
exhaustiveness by the compiler.

### "bluetooth must be turned on"

You need to wait for the bluetooth adapter to fully turn on.

`await Bluebird.adapterState.where((state) => state == BluetoothAdapterState.on).first;`

You can also use `Bluebird.adapterState.listen(...)`. See [Usage](#usage).

---

### adapterState is not 'on' but my Bluetooth is on

**For iOS:**

`adapterState` always starts as `unknown`. Wait for the service to report a real state:

```dart
await Bluebird.adapterState.firstWhere((state) => state != BluetoothAdapterState.unknown);
```

If `adapterState` is `unavailable`, you must add access to Bluetooth Hardware in the app's Xcode settings. See [Getting Started](#getting-started).

**For Android:**

Check that your device supports Bluetooth & has permissions.

---

### adapterState is called multiple times

You are forgetting to cancel the original `Bluebird.adapterState.listen` resulting in multiple listeners.

```dart
// tip: using ??= makes it easy to only make new listener when currently null
final subscription ??= Bluebird.adapterState.listen((value) {
    // ...
});

// also, make sure you cancel the subscription when done!
subscription.cancel()
```

---

### Scanning does not find my device

**1. you're using an emulator**

Use a physical device.

**2. try using another ble scanner app**

* **iOS**: [nRF Connect](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nrf-connect-for-mobile/id1054362403)
* **Android**: [BLE Scanner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.macdom.ble.blescanner)

Install a BLE scanner app on your phone. Can it find your device?

**3. your device uses bluetooth classic, not BLE.**

Headphones, speakers, keyboards, mice, gamepads, & printers all use Bluetooth Classic.

These devices may be found in System Settings, but they cannot be connected to by Bluebird. Bluebird only supports Bluetooth Low Energy.

**4. your device stopped advertising.**

- you might need to reboot your device
- you might need to put your device in "discovery mode"
- your phone may have already connected automatically
- another app may have already connected to your device
- another phone may have already connected to your device

Try looking through system devices:

```dart
// search system devices. i.e. any device connected to by *any* app
List<BluetoothDevice> system = await Bluebird.systemDevices([]);
for (var d in system) {
    print('${d.platformName} already connected to! ${d.remoteId}');
    if (d.platformName == "myBleDevice") {
         await d.connect(); // must connect our app
    }
}
```

**5. your scan filters are wrong.**

- try removing all scan filters
- for `withServices` to work, your device must actively advertise the serviceUUIDs it supports

**6. Android: you're scanning too often**

On Android you can only start a scan 5 times per 30 second period. This is a platform restriction.

---

### Scanned device never goes away

This is expected.

Use `.accumulate(removeIfGone: ...)` if you want a device to drop out of the list once it stops advertising.

---

### iBeacons Not Showing

**iOS:**

iOS does not support iBeacons using CoreBluetooth. You must find a plugin meant for CoreLocation.

**Android:**

1. you need to enable location permissions, see [Getting Started](#getting-started)
2. you must pass `androidUsesFineLocation:true` to `Bluebird.scan()`.

---

### Connection fails

**1. Your ble device have low battery**

Bluetooth can become erratic when your peripheral device is low on battery.

**2. Your ble device may have refused the connection or have a bug**

Connection is a two-way process. Your ble device may be misconfigured.

**3. You may be on the edge of the Bluetooth range.**

The signal is too weak, or there are a lot of devices causing radio interference.

**4. Some phones have an issue connecting while scanning.**

The Huawei P8 Lite is one of the reported phones to have this issue. Try stopping your scanner before connecting.

**5. Try restarting your phone**

Bluetooth is a complicated system service, and can enter a bad state.

---

### connectionState is called multiple times

You are forgetting to cancel the original `device.connectionState.listen` resulting in multiple listeners.

```dart
// tip: using ??= makes it easy to only make new listener when currently null
final subscription ??= device.connectionState.listen((value) {
    // ...
});

// also, make sure you cancel the subscription when done!
subscription.cancel()
```

---

### The remoteId is different on Android versus iOS & macOS

This is expected. There is no way to avoid it.

For privacy, iOS & macOS use a randomly generated uuid. This uuid will periodically change.

e.g. `6920a902-ba0e-4a13-a35f-6bc91161c517`

Android uses the mac address of the bluetooth device. It never changes.

e.g. `05:A4:22:31:F7:ED`

---

### iOS: "[Error] The connection has timed out unexpectedly."

You can google this error. It is a common iOS ble error code.

It means your device stopped working. Bluebird cannot fix it.

---

### List of Bluetooth GATT Errors

These GATT error codes are part of the BLE Specification.

**These are *responses* from your ble device because you are sending an invalid request.**

Bluebird cannot fix these errors. You are doing something wrong & your device is responding with an error.

**GATT errors as they appear on iOS**:
```

### characteristic write fails

First, check the [List of Bluetooth GATT Errors](#list-of-bluetooth-gatt-errors) for your error.

**1. your bluetooth device turned off, or is out of range**

If your device turns off or crashes during a write, it will cause a failure.

**2. Your Bluetooth device has bugs**

Maybe your device crashed, or is not sending a response due to software bugs.

**3. there is radio interference**

Bluetooth is wireless and will not always work.

---

### Characteristic read fails

First, check the [List of Bluetooth GATT Errors](#list-of-bluetooth-gatt-errors) for your error.

**1. your bluetooth device turned off, or is out of range**

If your device turns off or crashes during a read, it will cause a failure.

**2. Your Bluetooth device has bugs**

Maybe your device crashed, or is not sending a response due to software bugs.

**3. there is radio interference**

Bluetooth is wireless and will not always work.

---

### notifications are never received

**1. you are not listening to the right stream**

`chr.notifications` emits only notify/indicate values. `chr.values` also includes
the result of `chr.read()`. Neither emits your own `chr.write()` calls.

**2. your device has nothing to send**

With notify/indicate, your _device_ chooses when to send data.

Try interacting with your device to get it to send new data.

**3. your device has bugs**

Try rebooting your ble device.

Some ble devices have buggy software and stop sending data

---

### notification data is split up

Verify that the mtu is large enough to hold your message.

```dart
device.mtu.value
```

If it still happens, it is a problem with your peripheral device.

---

### notifications arrive with duplicate data

You are probably listening to `chr.notifications` more than once. Because listening
enables notify on the peripheral, each active listener receives every value — hold a
single subscription (or use `subscribe()` + `notificationsPassive`).

```dart
final subscription = chr.notifications.listen((value) {
    // ...
});

// cancel when you are done (this also disables notify on the peripheral)
device.cancelWhenDisconnected(subscription);
```

---

### ANDROID_SPECIFIC_ERROR

There is no 100% solution.

Bluebird already has mitigations for this error, but Android will still fail with this code randomly.

The recommended solution is to `catch` the error, and retry.

---

### android pairing popup appears twice

This is a bug in android itself.

You can call `createBond()` yourself just after connecting and this will resolve the issue.

---

### MissingPluginException(No implementation found for method XXXX ...)

If you just added bluebird to your pubspec.yaml, a hot reload / hot restart is not enough.

You need to fully stop your app and run again so that the native plugins are loaded.

Also try `flutter clean`.
